Software task checklist:

1) Convert SVG paths to G-code paths.
2) Select between multiple tools.
3) Automatically calibrate tool location.
4) Follow tool path.
5) Seperatly or synchronously move both axes.
6) Create drawings that resemble the tool path.


Testing plan:

Environmental paramaters:
- Machine should be assembled correctly on a flat, rigid, non-vibrating surface.
- Nothing should be within the path of travel of either axis that is not part of the machine itself.
- Pens should be mounted such that their tips touch the top edge of the bearing mounts (i.e, Chunks of grey plastic)
- Cables are to be located and taped down such that they do not interfere with the travel of the axes.

1: Accuracy testing:
- Create SVG and tool path consisting of multiple 100 mm lines with both tools, along both axes.
- Download ncc file onto robot.
- Run program manually.
- Select calibrate.
- Select file. Find file name (test.ncc)
- Allow to run to completion.
- Measure lines produced.

2: Speed testing:
- Run program from RobotC
- Select Joystick mode on display.
- Measure time taken to move tool from one end of page to another.
- Compare distance per unit time to specified speed.

3: Size testing:
a) Within 5mm of paper
- Run program from RobotC
- Select Joystick mode on display
- Run tool to edge of paper
- Observe that tool is at edge of paper, within spec.
- Repeat for all edges.


4: Integrity:
- Download any particular toolpath.
- Execute toolpath.
- Observe intactness of paper.
